```bash
# replace with real mariadb root password
docker-compose exec db sh -c 'MYSQL_PWD=my-mariadb-root-password mysql standardnotes'
```

```sql
-- replace <EMAIL@ADDR> with real email address used to register standardnotes account
INSERT INTO user_roles (role_uuid, user_uuid) VALUES ( (SELECT uuid FROM roles WHERE name="PRO_USER" ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1), (SELECT uuid FROM users WHERE email="<EMAIL@ADDR>") ) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE role_uuid = VALUES(`role_uuid`);
```

```sql
-- replace <EMAIL@ADDR> with real email address used to register standardnotes account and subscription_id with incrementing integer values for every user_subscriptions record added
INSERT INTO user_subscriptions SET uuid = UUID(), plan_name="PRO_PLAN", ends_at = 8640000000000000, created_at = 0, updated_at = 0, user_uuid= (SELECT uuid FROM users WHERE email="<EMAIL@ADDR>"), subscription_id=1, subscription_type=1;
```
